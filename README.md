# Disaster-Management
 Website to prevent, manage the impact of natural disasters
      We are going to prepare a Website. This website is going to help people before any Natural disasters as it will notify people as soon as The India Meteorological Department warns a particular area. In case people are trapped due to the consequences of the Natural disaster and they have internet access then this Website can bridge the gap between the victims and Rescue squad or Government through Surveys , Location access etc. This website will also contain videos which will keep them motivated and help them to manage the situation.
      For areas where internet connectivity is possible during the difficult time of disasters:
→ Basically we will be creating a website where we will be having various portals for various natural disasters.  Each disaster portal will be acting specifically different in times of alert or warning or even in the midway of a disaster and in times when there is very little chance of that particular disaster.
→ While there are little chances of a particular disaster the site will be displaying various prevention means and evacuation measures if a disaster will happen in the future. It will also include various managing ways and videos which will help people to know about the disaster a bit more ,enough to understand it and take appropriate actions whenever needed.
→ While in times of disaster ,we will embed various facilities into our site for managing and properly citing out rules for procedures for evacuation or for that matter,any other thing that will enable the people to be updated about the foregoings ,risks and coming warnings if necessary.
Google forms will be embedded into our site for the people to convey their griefs or any other information that they may want to communicate to us. This way,we will also get updated about all the problems that are being faced by the people so that remedial measures can be taken.
→ During the time of disaster we will have a link which will directly inform the user of the nearby safe places where they can take shelter.
→ Links for applying for volunteering as part of this project  will be open all the time .Here applying will only mean giving us sufficient information so that we minimally know a volunteer at a personal level.This way we will have an ever growing community of volunteers who will help us and the government to tackle any calamity that we may face in the future.
→ The site will be updated as and when necessary. Warnings and alerts will be issued whenever we will be getting information from various sources such as the Meteorological Department of India. 
       Users can login into the website and create their personal account in the website.The users can give their location alert to the site so as to notify them and make them quick alert about he situation. As the users get into the site they will see a couple of templates mentioning ‘Related videos’ , ‘Past issues’ ,’disaster management’ etc., With the help of these the users can know and get knowledge about the natural disasters and how to take preventive measures and what are all the serious damage that could take place due to the calamities. The users can understand the losses and consequences through the material provided in the site.
        The users will also have an opportunity to serve their people providing a service becoming volunteers. The volunteers can get a frequent information regarding the issues and provide support to people nearby by helping them.
